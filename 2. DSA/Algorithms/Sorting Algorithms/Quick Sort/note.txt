Rule: Find the minimum element from unsorted array and swap it with the element at the begining of unsorted array.

Time Complexity:
   ->O(n^2)  [Worst Case]
   ->θ(nlogn)  [Avg case]
   ->Ω(nlogn)    [Best case]

Space complexity: Inplace algorithm 

Adaptive: No (Adaptive means if array is already sorted it should take less time to sort)

Recursive: Yes

Stable : NO (stability of sorting algo means if there are 2 or  more same value in input then in output these value will be in order as in input array)
