Rule: Repetedly swap the two adjacent element if they are in wrong order.
i.e arr[i] > srr[i+1]

Time Complexity:
   ->O(n^2)  [Worst Case]
   ->θ(n^2)  [Avg case]
   ->Ω(n^2)    [Best case]


Space complexity: Inplace algorithm O(n)

Adaptive: Not ny default  (Adaptive means if array is already sorted it should take less time to sort)

Recursive: no

Stable : yes (stability of sorting algo means if there are 2 or  more same value in input then in output these value will be in order as in input array)
