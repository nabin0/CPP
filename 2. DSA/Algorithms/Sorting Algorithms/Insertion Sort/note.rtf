Rule: Insert an element from an unsorted array to its correct position in sorted array.

Time Complexity:
   ->O(n^2)  [Worst Case]
   ->θ(n^2)  [Avg case]
   ->Ω(n)     [Best case]


   
Space complexity: Inplace algorithm O(n)

Adaptive: Yes  (Adaptive means if array is already sorted it should take less time to sort)

Recursive: no

Stable : yes (stability of sorting algo means if there are 2 or  more same value in input then in output these value will be in order as in input array)
