Binary Search is a Searching algorithm used to search element in arrays[Data Structure].
To apply Binary search in an array, array must be sorted otherwise it will not work.


Time Complexity of Binary search:
   -> Big O(log(n))         i.e O(logn)
   -> Big Omega(1)          i.e Ω(1)
   -> Big theta(log(n))     i.e θ(logn)
