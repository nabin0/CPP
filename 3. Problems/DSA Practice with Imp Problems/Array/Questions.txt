1. Reverse the array
2. Find the maximum and minimum element in an array
3. Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array :
    e.g: if arr[] = {1,4,5,6,7} and k = 2
    then the 1st largest element is 7 but k=2 so kth (i.e 2nd largest ) element is 6

4. Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo
5. Move all the negative elements to one side of the array
